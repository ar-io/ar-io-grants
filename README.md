# AR.IO Foundation Grant Program

The AR.IO Foundation functions as the steward of the network, balancing its growth and development with a commitment to the community's needs and the network's foundational ethos. In support of this role, The AR.IO Foundation has developed a grants program to help empower and incentivise the AR.IO community to contribute to the Network's long-term success.

## Grant Focus Areas

### Licensing

#### Open Source requirement
By default, all work funded via the grants program should be open-source and publicly available using one of the approaved licensing options:

1. **Permissive Licenses** - MIT or Apache 2.0
Use for tools, libraries or widely reusable code

2. **Copyleft Licenses** - GPLv3, AGPLv3 (for hosted services)
Use for governance tools, infrastructure, or systems where openness must be preserved.

3. **Dual Licensing (Recommended)**
Combine a copyleft license (e.g. AGPLv3) with a permissive license (e.g. Apache 2.0). Encourages adoption while protecting openness.


#### Closed sourced exceptions
Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for integrations with existing ecosystem tooling. These proposal should have the potential for significant impact on the growth, adoption and utility of the AR.IO Network to be considered. If a closed source exception is granted, the Grantee must provide a detailed technical write-up of the integration to be shared publicly with the AR.IO Community.

### Evaluation Criteria

The Grants committee will evaluate applications based on the following criteria:

| **Criteria**    | **Description**                                                                            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact          | Will this proposal directly and positively impact the AR.IO Ecosystem.          |
| Innovation      | What innovation does this grant bring to AR.IO Network that differentiates it from existing solutions.           |
| Experience      | Do the grantees have the relevant knowledge to deliver the proposal successfully.           |
| Feasibility     | Is the proposal sufficiently scoped with clear and achievable milestones.                     |
| Mission/Vision  | Does the proposal align with the mission/vision of AR.IO Network.             |

### Milestone Reporting

#### Milestone Delivery

Milestones should be reported publicly on the original Github Issue.

#### Milestone Review

The Grant Committee will review the milestone submission and may issue comments and request changes on the issue. Their feedback needs to be resolved before a milestone can be accepted. Meetings with the Grantee can be requested if needed to discuss comments and changes requests prior to the milestone being accepted.

#### Milestone Payment

Payments are usually processed within 14 days. Payments are made in ARIO to the wallet specified in the Grant Application. The exchange rate for ARIO will be calculated based on the price of ARIO on coingecko at time of payment.

Grant applications can be amended by the Grants Committee. However, this necessitates a reevaluation by the committee.
